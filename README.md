# SERNtask
SERNtask is an application that organizes your projects and daily tasks in an easy and comfortable way.

This project is part of a great course by JUAN PABLO DE LA TORRE VALDEZ that I have done!
Honestly, I made this project before...but I did it using api fecht and had managed the errors in other way. Also I tried to do things like: use the bind method in logical function for link token in bearer...and anothers ways that I have learned in the bootcamp. Now I changed all this things!!! I have used api axios, token is passed for headers like x-auth-token, errors are manage like axios methods do, and obviously trying to  structure logic, components, routes... the best way posible to  have a clean, reusable, and scalable code. Also I did new functionability and the most importantly, I improved my skills and I have a better  understanding of the code. Its one step forward in building my coding carreer.
